# First time for everything
## Motivation
I've wondered, for a while, if I can really step outside of my zone of comfort to pick up new skills in an unfamiliar landscape.
Back in the day, modern application development was called "programming in the large".
My CS degree focused on the academic, nice enough, but only covered 20% of what I would do in the professional world.
As a DBA, most of my personal coding is "in the small".

I've installed IntelliJ IDEA and it is very intimidating.
We're far beyond gcc and a single .c file.
The IDE keeps trying to do things for me.
It looks very helpful but I'm not there yet.

Let's go.
